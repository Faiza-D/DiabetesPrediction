Diabetes Prediction Model
This project is a simple diabetes prediction application built using Python and Tkinter. It utilizes logistic regression for predicting diabetes based on various health features. The application provides an interactive user interface to input features and receive a prediction result directly on the same page.

Features
Interactive GUI: Built using Tkinter for easy input and result display.
Logistic Regression Model: Trained using a dataset to predict diabetes risk.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and scales features for better model performance.
Visual Feedback: Displays prediction results and probabilities directly in the application.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

Install Dependencies:

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:


pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

Dataset:

Make sure to place your diabetes.csv dataset in the project directory or adjust the file path in the code.

Enter Data:

Input values for each feature in the provided fields.

Get Prediction:

Click the "Predict" button to receive the prediction result and probabilities displayed on the same page.

Code Overview
diabetes_prediction.py: Main script containing the Tkinter GUI and logistic regression model code.
diabetes.csv: The dataset used for training the model (make sure it is placed in the correct path).
